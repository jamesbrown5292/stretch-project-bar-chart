    <h1>Welcome to James's Graph Generator!</h1>
    <h2>About the graph generator</h2>
    <p>The graph generator is a simple app designed
      to demonstrate fundamental skills in html, css, javascript
       and jQuery. The generator takes in a series of data points
        from the user, and returns a graphical representation
        of the data, giving the user the ability to
        customize the graph's appearance. </p>
    <h2>How to use the graph generator</h2>
    <p>To get started with your graph, use the boxes below to
      create a data set, then watch as your graph appears.
    </p>

    <input type="text" placeholder="My Bar Chart">
    <input type="submit">

    <p>Now, give your data series a title. This might be, for example, "types of fruit" or "dietary preferences"</p>
    <input type="text" placeholder="My Data Series">
    <input type="submit">

    <p>Next, we need to enter some data. Use the input fields below to enter a category and a value for that category. For example, you might enter "apples, 13" or "pescatarians, 20"</p>
    <p>Data item:
      <input type="text"  placeholder="e.g. Apples">
      Value:
      <input type="number" placeholder="12">
      <input type="submit">

    </p>
    <p>When you have finished creating your data series, click "Generate Graph" to see your graph.</p>
    <input type="button" value="Generate Graph!">
